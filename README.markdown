# Open URL plugin for Vim

Opens URLs on the current line in your OS X default browser.

Also handles other URIs, e.g. from Spotify.

Trigger with `<leader>u` or `:OpenURL`.

Uses John Gruber's excellent [URL regexp](http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls).


## Caveats

OS X only (uses `open`).


## Playground

Try it out on these:

URL: http://example.com

Two URLs, one line: http://example.com/#foo and http://example.com/?foo=bar#baz

Spotify URI: spotify:track:6JEK0CvvjDjjMUBFoXShNZ
